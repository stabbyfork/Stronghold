# Stronghold

Faction bot for Discord

More info on the website: https://stronghold.kasekorp.com/

Originally a closed-source bot with little intention of going open source, so code may be poorly readable and branches have barely been used.
You are free to host this yourself, however complications may arise with data saving. To install, simply clone the repository and run `npm install`.

# AI Notice:
Only some lengthy commit names have been written with AI.
Code is very minimally AI. Some small ideas have been drawn by AI, and code has been refined.
