# Stronghold

Faction bot for Discord

More info on the website: https://stronghold.kasekorp.com/

Originally a closed-source bot with little intention of going open source, so code may be poorly readable and branches have barely been used.

## Setup & Hosting

You are free to host this yourself (to the extent allowed by the license), however complications may arise with data saving.
- To install, simply clone the repository and run `npm install`
- Create `src/config.json` and fill it out according to `config.json.schema`
- Run with `npm run bundleAndRestart`

## AI Notice:
Some lengthy commit descriptions are written with AI.
Code is very minimally AI. Some ideas were drawn and some functions were refined by AI.
