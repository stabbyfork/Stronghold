# Stronghold

Faction bot for Discord

More info on the website: https://stronghold.kasekorp.com/ (https://github.com/StrongholdBot/stronghold-website)

Originally a closed-source bot with little intention of going open source, so the code may be poorly readable, and branches have barely been used.

## Setup & Hosting

You are free to host this yourself (to the extent allowed by the license); however, complications may arise regarding data saving.
- To install, simply clone the repository and run `npm install`
- Create `src/config.json` and fill it out according to `config.json.schema`
- Run with `npm run bundleAndRestart`

## AI Notice

Some lengthy commit descriptions are written with AI (something it's really good at).

Code is very minimally AI-written. Very few functions were refined by AI.
Copilot's autocomplete is used frequently, but it simply saves time, rather than creating and implementing ideas.
AI-generated code/additions are thoroughly verified.

Almost all detailed function documentation (JSDocs) is AI-written and human-refined. I am a programmer, not a novel author.
